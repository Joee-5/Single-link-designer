# ðŸ”— Single Link Designer

**Single Link Designer** is a C++ application developed to aid in the design and analysis of a single-link robotic arm or mechanical linkage.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Accepts user input for link dimensions, payload mass and maximum angular acceleration
- Calculates optimized arm dimensions depending on the chosen material
- Gives the best pair available from the motors/gearboxes database that fulfils user's requirements 
- Uses object-oriented programming principles

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- Language: C++
- Tools: Code::Blocks, or any standard C++ IDE

---

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/single-link-designer.git
   ```
2. Compile the `.cpp` file:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o singlelink
   ```
3. Run it:
